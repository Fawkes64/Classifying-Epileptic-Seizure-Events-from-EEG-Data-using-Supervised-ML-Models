# Classifying-Epileptic-Seizure-Events-from-EEG-Data-using-Supervised-ML-Models
EE502 Class Project

This repository holds a copy of the Pre-Processed CHB MIT EEG Dataset along with MATLAB code describing an ML pipeline used to attempt to perform seizure event classification on the dataset. To use this code and data, ensure in line 11 of the MATLAB code to properly put the directory you have the unzipped dataset file structure in. In addition, I fully encourage you to ensure you are using MATLAB 2022B or newer as this was developed upon this version and only tested on this version of MATLAB.
